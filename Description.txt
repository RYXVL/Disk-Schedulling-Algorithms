Project Title: Demonstrate the use of various disk schedulling algorithms.

Following are the steps to use the code: -
1. The I/O requests can be given manually to the code or the code can use the already hardcorded values inside.
   (1-Manual Insertion ; 0-Hardcoded Values)
   On entering 1 the I/O request queue length has to be specified and the corresponding request values have to be given thereafter.
2. All the different algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, C-LOOK) have been constructed as seperate modules and can be chosen
   to be used as user pleases to.
3. All algorithms would ask for the manual insertion for the current head value (initial head value).
4. Some algorithms like SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK and C-LOOK will ask for an additional information i.e., chosing to run the algorithm on
   the inner or the outer track first. Inner track represents going towards the lower numbered requests first and outer track represents
   going towards the higher numbered requests first.
5. Depending on the algorithm chosen a table consisting of the iteration number, current head (after movement), amount of disc movement to reach this
   current head value and the overall disk movement so far will be displayed, followed by the total head movement (after the completion of the algorithm),
   order of processing the I/O requests, and the average seek time required in the algorithm used by the user.
